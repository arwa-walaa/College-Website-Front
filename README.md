# Discription 
E-community (e-com) is a website for the benefit of both students and 
faculty staff members in FCAI. It provides a set of comprehensive 
features to support students to register for courses, chatting with Professors and TAs, notifications for every important announcement , and viewing their 
grades and exam halls, get to know the schedule and more. 
Professors and teaching assistants can view the number of students 
registered in every course, statistics for students, fill-in attendance sheets, and more. In this 
project, we update the existing website of the e-com to make it more 
friendly and easier to deal with its provided features. Also, we add 
new features to enrich the website with more features that can 
benefit the target users, and make it easier to use and user-friendly.
